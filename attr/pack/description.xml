    <summary>Utilities for manipulating filesystem extended attributes</summary>
    <p>
        A set of tools for manipulating extended attributes on filesystem
    objects, in particular getfattr(1) and setfattr(1). An attr(1) command is
    also provided which is largely compatible with the SGI IRIX tool of the same
    name.
