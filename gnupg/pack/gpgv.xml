        <summary>GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool</summary>
        <p>
        GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
        </p>
        <p>
        gpgv is a stripped-down version of gnupg which is only able to check
        signatures.  It is smaller than the full-blown gnupg and uses a
        different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys used to
        make the signature are trustworthy.
