            <summary>GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement</summary>
            <p>
            GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
            It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
            It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
            with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
            </p>
            <p>
            GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
            the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
            with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
            environments, but also with less dependencies.
            </p>
            <p>
            The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
            HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
            the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.
            </p>
            <p>
            GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms. This means it cannot be
            compatible with PGP2, because that uses IDEA (which is patented in
            a number of countries).
