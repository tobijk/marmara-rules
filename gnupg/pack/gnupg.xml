        <summary>GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement</summary>
        <p>
        GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
        It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
        It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
        with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
        </p>
        <p>
        GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
        the version 2 series, it comes with no support for S/MIME and some
        other tools useful for desktop environments, but also with less
        dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
        GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms. This means it cannot be
        compatible with PGP2, because that uses IDEA (which is patented in
        a number of countries).
