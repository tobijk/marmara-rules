        <summary>command-line interface parsing library</summary>
        <p>
        This package includes a tool that parses a command table to generate
        a simple command-line interface parser, the include files needed to
        compile and use it, and the static libs.
        </p>
        <p>
        It was originally inspired by the Multics SubSystem library.
