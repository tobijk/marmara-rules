        <p>
        The ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems are successors of the original ext
        (&quot;extended&quot;) file system. They are the main file system types used for
        hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package provides the ext2fs and e2p libraries, for userspace software
        that directly accesses extended file systems. Programs that use libext2fs
        include e2fsck, mke2fs, and tune2fs. Programs that use libe2p include
        dumpe2fs, chattr, and lsattr.
