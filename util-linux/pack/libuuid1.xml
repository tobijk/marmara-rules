        <summary>Universally Unique ID library</summary>
        <p>
        The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique
        ids (UUIDs).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
        space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can
        be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
        short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
        across a network.
