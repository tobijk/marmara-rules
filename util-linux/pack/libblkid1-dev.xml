        <summary>block device id library - headers and static libraries</summary>
        <p>
        The blkid library which allows system programs like fsck and
        mount to quickly and easily find block devices by filesystem UUID and
        LABEL.  This allows system administrators to avoid specifiying
        filesystems by hard-coded device names, but via a logical naming
        system instead.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package contains the development environment for the blkid library.
