        <p>
        XML is a metalanguage to let you design your own markup language.
        A regular markup language defines a way to describe information in
        a certain class of documents (eg HTML). XML lets you define your
        own customized markup languages for many classes of document. It
        can do this because it's written in SGML, the international standard
        metalanguage for markup languages.
        </p>
        <p>
        This package provides a library providing an extensive API to handle
        such XML data files.
