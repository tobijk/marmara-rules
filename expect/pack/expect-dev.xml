        <summary>A program that can automate interactive applications (development)</summary>
        <p>
        Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications according to a script.
        Following the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what
        the correct response should be. Expect is also useful for testing these same
        applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in
        X11 GUIs. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control
        structures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and
        interact directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script.
