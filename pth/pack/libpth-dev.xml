        <summary>The GNU Portable Threads (development)</summary>
        <p>
        Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms which
        provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple threads of
        execution (&quot;multithreading&quot;) inside server applications. All threads run in the
        same address space of the server application, but each thread has its own
        individual program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.
