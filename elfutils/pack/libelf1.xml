        <summary>library to read and write ELF files</summary>
        <p>
        The libelf1 package provides a shared library which allows reading and
        writing ELF files on a high level.  Third party programs depend on
        this package to read internals of ELF files.  The programs of the
        elfutils package use it also to generate new ELF files.
        </p>
        <p>
        This library is part of elfutils.
