        <summary>Documentation system for on-line information and printed output</summary>
        <p>
        Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
        produce both on-line information and printed output.
        </p>
        <p>
        Using Texinfo, you can create a printed document with the normal features
        of a book, including chapters, sections, cross references, and indices. 
        From the same Texinfo source file, you can create a menu-driven, on-line
        Info file with nodes, menus, cross references, and indices.
