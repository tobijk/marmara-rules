        <summary>curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG</summary>
        <p>
        This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
        pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
        information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
        This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
        when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
        the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
        particular software.

        <p>
        The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
        using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users working
        in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling packages
        that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If you
        install any of the latter packages then this package is not necessary
        because the sibling packages automatically fall back to text mode if
        X is not active.
