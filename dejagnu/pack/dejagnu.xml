        <summary>framework for running test suites on software tools</summary>
        <p>
        DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs.  Its purpose is to
        provide a single front end for all tests.
        </p>
        <p>
        DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction which allows you to write
        tests that are portable to any host or target where a program must
        be tested.  All tests have the same output format.
        </p>
        <p>
        DejaGnu is written in `expect', which in turn uses &quot;Tcl&quot;--Tool
        command language.
