        <summary>Pluggable Authentication Modules library</summary>
        <p>
        Contains the C shared library for Linux-PAM, a suite of shared
        libraries that enable the local system administrator to choose how
        applications authenticate users.  In other words, without rewriting
        or recompiling a PAM-aware application, it is possible to switch
        between the authentication mechanism(s) it uses.  One may entirely
        upgrade the local authentication system without touching the
        applications themselves.
