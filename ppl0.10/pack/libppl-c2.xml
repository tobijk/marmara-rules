        <summary>Parma Polyhedra Library (C interface)</summary>
        <p>
        The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is a C++ library for the
        manipulation of (not necessarily closed) convex polyhedra and other
        numerical abstractions.  The applications of convex polyhedra include
        program analysis, optimized compilation, integer and combinatorial
        optimization and statistical data-editing.  The Parma Polyhedra
        Library is user friendly (you write `x + 2*y + 5*z &lt;= 7' when you
        mean it), fully dynamic (available virtual memory is the only
        limitation to the dimension of anything), written in standard C++,
        exception-safe, rather efficient and thoroughly documented.

        This package provides the C interface.
