            <summary>An utility for Directing compilation.</summary>
            <p>
            GNU Make is an utility which controls the generation of executables and
            other target files of a program from the program's source files. It
            determines automatically which pieces of a large program need to be
            (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create them. Make is not
            limited to programs and executable, it can be applied to any task
            where a set of target files must be created based on a set of input
            files, based on dependency and processing rules. Indeed, Make is a
            general purpose dependency solver.
