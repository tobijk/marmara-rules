        <summary>XZ-format compression library</summary>
        <p>
        XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
        compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
        compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
        </p>
        <p>
        The native format of liblzma is XZ; it also supports raw (headerless)
        streams and the older LZMA format used by lzma. (For 7-Zip's related
        format, use the p7zip package instead.)
