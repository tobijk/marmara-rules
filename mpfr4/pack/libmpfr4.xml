        <p>
        MPFR provides a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation
        with correct rounding.  The computation is both efficient and has a
        well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the
        ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic
        (53-bit mantissa).
