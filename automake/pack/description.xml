    <summary>A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles</summary>
    <p>
    Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
    files called `Makefile.am'.
    </p>
    <p>
    The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
    from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
    of the Automake maintainer).
    </p>
    <p>
    The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
    (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
    `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
