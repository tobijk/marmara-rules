        <summary>A front-end using readline to &quot;cook&quot; input lines for other programs</summary>
        <p>
        This tool lets you use history and line-editing in any text oriented
        tool. This is especially useful with third-party proprietary tools that
        cannot be distributed linked against readline. It is not perfect but it
        works pretty well.

        <p>
        See the ledit and rlwrap packages for other programs of that kind.
