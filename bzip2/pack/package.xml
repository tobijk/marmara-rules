            <p>
            This package contains libbzip2 and the bzip2 compressor tool.
            </p>
            <p>
            bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. 
            It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
            techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
            times faster at decompression.
            </p>
            <p>
            bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
            compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
            considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
            LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
            family of statistical compressors.
            </p>
            <p>
            The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
            predecessor, bzip (.bz).
